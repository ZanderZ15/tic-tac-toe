This is Tictactoe!
Forked from gdevine

#1: Added get methods for Square col and row for testing purposes but that is all that I changed outside of TicTacToe.cpp

#2: I noticed that pieceForPlayer wasnt choosing the right player so I changed what it was looking for from 1 to 0 as well as the winner dialogue that pops up in Application.cpp

Initial comments of instructions were replaced with comments describing the functions for readibility
